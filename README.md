# SQAandT
This repository contains tests and testing configurations for the project of the course Software Testing and Quality Assurance.
This is not an original implementation but rather a testing environment created specifically to practice and apply concepts from Software Testing: A Craftsman's Approach by Paul C. Jorgensen. The code in this repository is adapted for testing purposes only and is intended for personal, educational use.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to practice software testing techniques by running tests on an existing codebase. 
These tests cover a range of concepts from unit and integration testing to boundary value analysis, equivalence partitioning, and more, as described in the book:
 "Software Testing: A Craftsman's Approach."
